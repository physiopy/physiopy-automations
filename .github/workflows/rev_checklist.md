Hello @__REV__!

You've been assigned to this PR, which means that you've been nominated as reviewer! You are a supporting reviewer, not the main reviewer  - the main reviewer has more responsibilities than you (lucky them) but your review is still important. 

If you have any doubt, check [this section on reviewing](https://phys2bids.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contributorfile.html#reviewing) 

Checklist 
- [ ] one
- [ ] two
- [ ] three

Thank you!
