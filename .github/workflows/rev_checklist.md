Hello @__REV__!

You've been assigned to this PR, which means that you've been nominated as reviewer! You are a supporting reviewer, not the main reviewer. The main reviewer has more responsibilities than you (lucky them) but your review is still important. 

For a guide, check out [this section on reviewing](https://phys2bids.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contributorfile.html#reviewing). Please see the checklist that the main reviewer has been given (somewhere above this comment) and consider what support you can provide to them. 

Thank you!
